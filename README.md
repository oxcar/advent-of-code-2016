# Advent of Code 2016

This repo holds my [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016/) solutions.

I'm using Scala (2.12) to improve my skills. 

My objetive is to make the best code I can and try to solve the problems using functional programming, hoping to learn something in the process. 

I do not intend to compete for fast times on the leaderboards this year.
